# GoPro Hero 7 Black

The last GoPro camera with built in clean HDMI out. Does support RTMP streaming at low resolution.

## Quality

Low-light performance is poor.

## HDMI

Clean HDMI out. Signal is 1080p60, but it appears to be using frame doubling.

Audio and video can be out of sync in certain situations, and it seems to depend on on stabilization. Sync sometimes drifts as well, and is non-uniform (might be temperature related).

## Livestreaming

Camera support RTMP streaming at 720p30, but the implementation is very bad. Avoid.

## Power Usage

HDMI: x watts.
