## Notes

- Needs a USB3.0 port for YUY2 capture, but USB2.0 is sufficient for MJPEG.
- Works well with a variety of desktop resolutions under 1080p60.
  - Too bad they didn't go a little higher to 1920x1200, a very common computer monitor resolution.
- Officially supported under Linux by the manufacturer.

## Power Usage

- 1080p30 YUYV capture: 1.55 watts.
