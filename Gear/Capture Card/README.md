# Capture Card Documentation

Each capture card has it's own file with notes, quirks, etc.

**Note:** just because these cards have been tested, doesn't mean they're fully supported by Tailwind. While Tailwind does its best to make a card work, this doens't guarantee it'll be successful or that it'll work well.
