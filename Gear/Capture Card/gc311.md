## Notes

- Only needs a USB2.0 port because it does encoding on the device.
- The H.264 seems a bit quirky sometimes, probably an old implementation, but generally seems to work. It can crash the encoder from time to time.
- Has HDMI passthrough.

## Power Usage

- 1080p30 H264 capture: x watts.
- 1080p30 MJPEG capture: x watts.
