# MacroSilicon MS2109 Capture Device / "Can'tlink"

Very cheap uncompressed video. Image quality is poor, they don't actually support 1080p.

## Supported Formats

### 1080p60

```
fill

```

## Notes

- Internally, these seem to capture at half the horizontal resolution (so 960x1080) and scale it. This leads to poor image quality.

## Power Usage

- 1080p30 MJPEG capture: x watts.
