# TC358743 HDMI to CSI-2 Bridge

A HDMI to MIPI CSI-2 bridge, optionally with I2S audio.

## Supported Formats

Note that these are dependent on how many CSI-2 lane are being used as well as the clock rate of these lanes. Different drivers will have different outputs versus below (for example, working AR24), so these are just illustrative.

The official documentation states they it supports:

- RGB, 8-bit, 60fps. RGB888, aka XR24?
- YCbCr444, 8-bit, 60fps. NV24?
- YCbCr422, 8-bit, 60fps. This is either NV16 or UYVY, as shown below.
- Either 1080p or 720p resolutions.
  - It has no onboard scaler, so it can only be fed at these two resolutions. It doesn't work when fed 4k, for example.

### 1080p60

XR24 seems bugged in this particular driver and not fully implemented.

## Notes

- Some versions available don't actually have audio implemented correctly.
- Some versions have issues with HDMI backpowering.
- To get 1080p60 on a 2-lane interface, the card will need to be clocked outside of spec, but this seems to work on most Jetson Nanos. No guarantee though, as 1080p50 is also _slight_ out of spec for two lanes (maximum per lane is approximately 750Mb/s and two 1080p50 needs about 1.56Gb/s, or just above the 1.5GB/s two lanes provides at the rated clocks).
- Get the C790 version. It has working I2S audio, both 2-lane (15-pin) and 4-lane (22-pin) interfaces, and seems to not have HDMI backpowering issues.

## Power Usage

- 1080p30 capture: around 0.5 watts. (Not measured directly.)
- 1080p60 capture: around 0.6 watts. (Not measured directly.)
