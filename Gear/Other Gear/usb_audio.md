# USB Audio

Some info on USB Audio devices.

| Model | Specs | Power | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Rode Wireless GO II | 24b Stereo Audio w/ LAV mics over USB, or 3.5mm input/output. | 0.4W to 0.6W (charging) |  |
| Rode Videomic NTG | 24b Mono Audio shotgun microphone. | 0.3W to 0.5W (charging) | Outputs stereo, but the microphone is mono. One output is normally a "safety" channel at -20dB, so this may sound odd in stereo. |
