# Other Useful Info

Intended to various bits and pieces that don't fit in elsewhere. This info is all available online, but I get asked questions about it a lot, so I decided to put together a reference I can easily point to.

## Pages

- Notes on [USB bandwidth](other_usb_bandwidth.md), reservation, etc.
- Notes on [Chroma Subsampling and Pixel Formats](chroma_sub_pix_fmt.md), because questions about these often come up.
