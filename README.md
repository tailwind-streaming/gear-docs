# IRL Streaming Hardware Documentation

This repo is intended for IRL hardweare/gear documentation, but includes general other useful information and documentation as well as details on tested hardware. The goal is to be a community resource applicable to anyone IRL streaming, whether or not they're using Tailwind to do so.

**Note:** adding more info is ongoing, so lots of pages are stubs or incomplete.

If you'd like to add something to these documents, please open a pull request. If you have questions about hardware, or Tailwind, please ask in our [Discord](). ToDo: fill in invite URL.
